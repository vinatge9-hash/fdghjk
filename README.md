# Pawsitive Care – Premium Dog Care

This repository contains a small, static, multi-page website for a premium dog care business named 'Pawsitive Care'. The site uses a warm, professional theme with a modern, clean design. It includes an integrated appointment booking and checkout flow (static HTML demos) across several pages.

What’s included:
- Home (index.html) with hero, image gallery, and testimonials
- Services (services.html) with Grooming, Daycare, Training sections
- About (about.html) with founder/story content
- Contact (contact.html) with form and an interactive map placeholder
- Checkout (checkout.html) with a simulated booking and payment flow
- Shared header and footer across all pages for consistency
- Responsive mobile navigation (hamburger menu)
- Scroll-based fade-in animations for sections
- Inline SVG icons (no external icon packs required)
- Placeholder images using the specific placeholder syntax described in the prompt
- Placeholder address set to Hyderabad, India as requested

Notes:
- The current year for copyright/footer notices is 2025 (as requested).
- All icons are inline SVGs to remain self-contained.
- The Swiper.js library is used for the home page gallery.
- The design uses a warm, soft blue, white, and light gray palette with Inter typography (and serif for branding via the header and footer).

How to run:
- Open the HTML files directly in a browser. The site is designed to be responsive and uses Tailwind CSS via CDN, so no build steps are required.
- The checkout flow is a static prototype but demonstrates how a real integration could be wired to a backend or payment gateway later.

If you’d like any adjustments (content tweaks, different service details, or additional sections), tell me and I’ll update the build.
